But what makes Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter 2012 a movie worth watching? Well, besides the intriguing premise and the historical references, the movie also delivers some thrilling action scenes and impressive visual effects. The director, Timur Bekmambetov, is known for his stylish and kinetic filmmaking, as seen in movies like Wanted and Night Watch. He brings his flair for fast-paced and inventive action to this movie, creating some memorable sequences such as Lincoln's axe-fighting training, his showdown with Barts on a horse stampede, and the climactic battle on a burning train bridge.
 
The movie also benefits from a solid cast of actors who take their roles seriously and avoid campiness. Benjamin Walker, who bears a striking resemblance to the real Lincoln, portrays the president as a man of courage, conviction and compassion, who is also haunted by his personal losses and his moral dilemmas. Dominic Cooper adds some charm and mystery as Henry Sturgess, Lincoln's mentor and ally in the vampire hunting business. Mary Elizabeth Winstead gives a dignified and supportive performance as Mary Todd Lincoln, Lincoln's wife and confidante. And Rufus Sewell makes a menacing and charismatic villain as Adam, the leader of the vampires who wants to destroy Lincoln and his nation.
 
Of course, Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter 2012 is not a movie for everyone. Some might find it too absurd or disrespectful to mix history and fantasy in such a way. Some might find it too violent or gory for their taste. And some might find it too shallow or simplistic in its portrayal of the complex issues of slavery and civil war. But for those who are looking for a fun and exciting movie that offers a different take on one of America's most revered figures, Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter 2012 might be just what they need.
